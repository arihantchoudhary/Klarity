This is a sample document for testing the PDF processing pipeline.

The RAGFlowPdfParser is designed to extract text, tables, and figures from PDF documents.
It uses a combination of OCR, layout analysis, and machine learning for high-quality content extraction.

# Sample Section 1: Introduction

PDF documents are widely used for sharing documents with rich formatting.
However, extracting structured information from PDFs can be challenging due to:
- Complex layouts
- Mixed content types (text, tables, images)
- Varying formatting styles

# Sample Section 2: Tables

Tables in documents contain structured data that is particularly valuable.
Below is a simple example table:

| ID | Name     | Department  | Salary |
|----|----------|------------|--------|
| 1  | John Doe | Engineering | 85000  |
| 2  | Jane Smith | Marketing  | 78000  |
| 3  | Robert Johnson | Finance    | 92000  |

# Sample Section 3: Lists and Bullets

The parser can handle various types of structural elements including:
• Numbered lists
• Bullet points
• Hierarchical sections
• Multi-column layouts

# Sample Section 4: Technical Details

The PDF processing pipeline includes several steps:
1. Text extraction with OCR and direct PDF parsing
2. Layout recognition to identify document structure
3. Table detection and structure recognition
4. Content chunking for semantic indexing
5. Vector embedding generation for semantic search

# Sample Section 5: Conclusion

This sample document provides test content for verifying:
- Basic text extraction
- Table structure recognition
- Document chunking
- Vector indexing functionality

The capabilities demonstrated here represent only a subset of what the full system can process.
