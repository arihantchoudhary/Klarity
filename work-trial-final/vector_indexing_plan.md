# Vector Indexing Plan

This document outlines the approach for implementing Dense Vector Indexing for document content retrieved from PDF files. It serves as a technical guide to the implemented solution.

## What is Dense Vector Indexing?

Dense Vector Indexing is a technique that stores high-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) of text or other content, enabling semantic similarity search. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, vector search can find conceptually similar content even when the exact keywords don't match.

## Implementation Approach

Our approach follows a 6-stage pipeline:

1. **Document Collection**: Gather and organize PDF documents
2. **Content Extraction**: Extract text, tables, and structural elements from PDFs
3. **Content Chunking**: Split extracted content into appropriate segments
4. **Vector Embedding**: Generate dense vector representations of each chunk
5. **Index Creation**: Build a searchable vector index
6. **Search Capability**: Enable semantic similarity search against the index

## Key Components

### 1. Document Collection and Inventory

- Scan the uploads directory to identify PDF files
- Create an inventory with metadata (file type, size, page count)
- Track extraction status for various content types

### 2. PDF Content Extraction

- Use the enhanced RAGFlowPdfParser to extract:
  - Main text content
  - Tables and their structure
  - Figures and diagrams
  - Document structure and layout

### 3. Content Chunking Strategy

Chunking divides text into segments that:
- Preserve semantic meaning
- Are appropriate size for the embedding model
- Maintain context where needed

Our implementation uses:
- Maximum chunk size of 512 tokens
- Overlap of 50 tokens between chunks for context continuity
- Natural breaking points (paragraphs, sections) where possible
- Special handling for tables and structural elements

### 4. Vector Embedding Generation

- Use Sentence Transformers models to generate embeddings
- Default model: 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' (384-dimensional vectors)
- Fallback to simulated embeddings if libraries unavailable
- Batch processing for efficiency

### 5. Vector Index Construction

- Use FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity search
- Store index, embeddings, and associated metadata
- Support for various index types:
  - Flat index for exact search (smaller datasets)
  - IVF index for approximate search (larger datasets)

### 6. Search and Retrieval

The vector index enables:
- Semantic similarity search based on query intent
- Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for efficiency
- Retrieval of original chunks and their source documents

## Benefits Over Traditional Search

1. **Semantic Understanding**: Captures meaning beyond exact keyword matches
2. **Handling Synonyms**: Recognizes different terms with similar meanings
3. **Contextual Relevance**: Better understands the context of search queries
4. **Language Flexibility**: Works across variations in phrasing and terminology

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

- Embedding generation is computationally intensive
- Using CPU vs. GPU has significant performance implications
- Index type selection affects search speed vs. accuracy tradeoff
- Chunk size affects both quality and performance

### Storage

- Vector indexes can be large (proportional to number of chunks Ã— vector dimension)
- Metadata storage is needed alongside the vectors
- Original chunks should be preserved for retrieval

### Scalability

- The current implementation supports batch processing
- For larger document collections, consider:
  - Distributed embedding generation
  - Hierarchical or sharded indexes
  - Progressive indexing strategies

## Implementation Next Steps

1. **Integration with Query Interface**: Create an API or UI for searching the index
2. **Relevance Tuning**: Refine search results with reranking or filtering
3. **Incremental Updates**: Allow adding new documents without rebuilding the entire index
4. **Performance Optimization**: Tune for specific hardware and document volumes
5. **Multi-Modal Extensions**: Add support for image embeddings and cross-modal search

## Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of the vector index:

1. **Recall@k**: Percentage of relevant documents found in top k results
2. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Average position of first relevant result
3. **Query Latency**: Time to return search results
4. **Index Build Time**: Time required to create the index
5. **Index Size**: Storage requirements for the vector index

## Usage Example

```python
# Create a vector indexer
indexer = VectorIndexer(output_dir="vector_index")

# Process documents and build index
inventory_df = pd.read_csv("file_inventory.csv")
indexer.process_and_index_files(inventory_df, uploads_dir="uploads")

# Search example (future implementation)
results = search_vector_index("What are the key metrics for evaluating embedding models?")
```
