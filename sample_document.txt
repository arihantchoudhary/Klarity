Vector indexing is a critical component of modern information retrieval systems.

The flat index is the simplest approach, where we store vectors as-is and compare directly.

Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) groups similar vectors into buckets using hash functions.

Inverted File (IVF) indexing uses clustering to organize vectors, allowing for faster retrieval.

Inverted File with Product Quantization (IVFPQ) further compresses vectors for efficient storage.

Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) creates a multi-layered graph that enables efficient nearest neighbor search.
